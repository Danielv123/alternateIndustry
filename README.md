# Daniels Alternative Industry

Or DAI if you preffer that

The goal of this mod is to provide more alternative ways of doing things. Some ideas I have though off are

* Multiple recipe paths, costing more of one or another resource

* Make all worlds biased toward one or another type of resource to encourage that paths

* Energy storage solutions with boiling salt

* High energy consumption machines that are more efficient when used in bursts to reward fancy solutions

# Details

*Ore processing*

Vanilla solution: iron ore -furnace> iron plate

Modded solution:

iron ore + limestone -blastfurnace> molten iron + slag

molten iron -casting machine> iron blate

molten iron -blastfurnace> molten steel 

molten iron + coal + steel plate -arc furnace> molten steel

molten steel -casting machine> steel plate

*Energy storage*

Vanilla solution: Accumulators

Modded solution:

Seawater -destiller> salt

Salt -arc furnace 161 J/g> molten salt 260c

molten salt 260c -electric boiler> molten salt 550c 1.53J/gK = 443MJ/ton

molten salt 550c -steam turbine> molten salt 260c
